Subject: Successful Transition to QWS3270 VBA COM Automation API for Mainframe Testing
Dear [Manager's Name],
I hope this message finds you well.
I am writing to share some exciting developments regarding our test automation efforts, particularly in our mainframe testing domain. Over the past few weeks, our team has been diligently working on addressing the runtime engine launch issues encountered with Micro Focus LeanFT when integrated with Eclipse.
After thorough exploration and testing, we have successfully transitioned to utilizing the QWS3270 VBA COM Automation API for our mainframe test automation needs. This transition not only resolved the aforementioned challenges but also brought about notable improvements in performance and eliminated the dependency on licensing costs associated with proprietary tools.
Our decision to embrace open-source solutions aligns with our commitment to efficiency and innovation. We have seamlessly incorporated the QWS3270 VBA COM Automation API into our existing Java framework, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration.
I am pleased to report that our initial tests have yielded promising results. A dry run of 50 scripts demonstrated excellent performance, reaffirming our confidence in this approach. Moving forward, we are enthusiastic about leveraging this methodology for automating the remaining test cases and future development efforts.
Furthermore, we are prepared to extend this approach to other projects within the team should there be interest. By sharing our success and best practices, we aim to foster collaboration and drive efficiency across our organization.
I would like to express my gratitude to the team for their dedication and hard work throughout this process. Their expertise and commitment have been instrumental in achieving this milestone.
Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. We are eager to continue our progress and contribute to the success of our projects.
Thank you for your support and leadership in guiding our automation initiatives.
Best regards,
[Your Name] [Test Automation Developer] [Your Contact Information]
